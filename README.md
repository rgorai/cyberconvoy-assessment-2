# Employee Management App

Welcome to Ron Gorai's submission for CyberConvoy's technical assessment II.

## Prerequisites

Node
port 3001 open

## Steps to Run


## Notes
- This is my first time implementing a MySQL database and Google OAuth, so I'm not very familiar with the best coding and security practices with these technologies, but I've attemptes to follow similar practices from what I have already used
- Some aspects of the application may seem slightly over-engineered for the scale of this app; these are pasted from my personal, relatively larger-scale projects
