# Employee Management App

Welcome to Ron Gorai's submission for CyberConvoy's technical assessment II.

## Prerequisites

Node
port 3001 open

## Steps to Run


## Notes
- This is my first time implementing a MySQL database, Google OAuth and TailwindCSS, so I'm not very familiar with the best coding and security practices with these technologies, so I've attempted them as best I can based on research and my experience with similar technologies
- even though it @@ session based handling, flashes
- Some aspects of the application may seem somewhat over-engineered for the scale of this app - these are pasted from my personal, relatively larger-scale projects
- I included these partially to expedite my development time for those aspects, but mainly to help convey my thought processes
- I left the console statements for API calls in so you can observe the state management conserving them in action
